    title: "Making sense of the cultural divide",
    subTitle: "The fork as a device for connecting Chinese consumers to Western cuisine",
    description: "One of the most common business issues our clients have is how to penetrate the Chinese market with their (Western) brand. Recently we concluded an in-depth study on consumption of Western cuisine with the end in mind to drive in-home consumption.\nWith the increasing popularity of Western cuisine, our task was to determine how we could translate the Western dining experience to in-home and identify the ‘enablers’ to make it easy and affordable for the Chinese consumer.\n\nWe found that one of the current barriers was not having the right cutlery and cooking tools to prepare Western meals at home. Given that the Chinese use about 80 billion disposable chopsticks each year (equivalent to 20 million trees annually), in comparison, 99% don’t have forks at home. While we are not advocating the end of chopsticks which is a cultural icon, there are things you can do with a fork that you can’t do with chopsticks, such as twirling pasta with a fork which Chinese consumers associate with the pasta eating experience.\n\nHence the fork which was traditionally seen as violent or barbaric, is now associated with the ‘romanticism’ of Western dining, thanks to the influence of Western movies, Pizza Hut and Ikea’s lifestyle section.\n\nIdentifying these ‘enablers’ helped our client devise their marketing strategy which focused on educating consumers and identifying the paths to purchase. ",
    bottomDescription: "″We were absolutely elated with your work and do look forward to doing work with you in the near future. The China focus groups were my first and it was a great learning for me. As our brand enters new markets and research is required, I can use that experience as a benchmark and know what to expect, the types of questions to inject, etc. You have set the bar very high. Please forward a list of countries that Acorn conducts research in for future reference.“",

    title: "Smaller Is Bette",
    subTitle:"How to get drinkers to drink more beer in Taiwan? A bigger bottle size? A bigger glass size?",
    description: "It is observed that Taiwanese love to bottoms up. However, a standard 500cc beer glass is just too much to bottoms up.\n\nHence drinkers end up sipping their beer and as time wears on, beer gets warm making it taste less ‘fresh’, and the slower it takes to finish the beer.\n\nHowever, a much smaller 143cc glass which is slightly more than a mouthful makes it ‘just right’ to bottoms up. This is followed immediately by an easy top up.  You don’t realise how it all adds up as you easily down each glass.\n\n\nSince a standard large bottle of beer is 600cc, this translates to about 4 small glasses. The average interlude in between conversation is 5-10 minutes.\n\nHence 2 drinkers would have consumed 1 large bottle in 10 minutes. Depending on how well the 2 drinkers can hold their alcohol, they can consume 6 large bottles of beer within 1 hour. Now that's a lot of beer!\n\nHence using a smaller glass in this case makes it go faster and helps increase consumption.",
    bottomDescription: "″I really liked the research work you commissioned Acorn.  You might consider sending that study out to the visitors so that they can get background understanding on the markets before arriving.  That was a really comprehensive review.  Probably one of the best I have seen for introducing people to new markets.“",

    title: "Innovating What's Best For Baby",
    subTitle: "The trend towards non-packaged baby food in Indonesia. How grassroots brands are doing it better.",
    description: "Mothers in Indonesia usually start feeding food other than breast milk to their children once they turn 6 months. There are a lot of options available like biscuits or instant porridge, but these manufactured products contain artificial sweeteners and preservatives.\n\nHence some mothers prefer to cook the food themselves. However mothers are finding it increasingly difficult with their busy schedules to cook porridge.\n\nWe recently observed that entrepreneurs have tapped into this opportunity and there are now hawkers/ food stalls selling food specially made for babies. The porridge is prepared fresh every day and is a much healthier option as it contains natural ingredients and is more affordable than the store-bought instant porridge. These sellers also sell steamed rice, soup, jelly and pudding for babies. The stalls are very colourful and carry a certificate from BPOM or a Halal logo, so that mothers are assured of product quality.\n\nThis trend has really picked up in the past 6 months and some of these food stalls have started offering franchises. The challenge for our international client has been to review their current strategy and product offering to ensure they keep up with the competition. ",
    bottomDescription: "″You did a terrific job - all of my colleagues were very impressed both with the insights from the research and your personal presentation. The presentation very much helped us secure the countries' buy-in and move forward with our plans. We will be in touch about extending the research to further countries.“",

    title: "Optimising Cut-Through",
    subTitle: "How do we get the media mix right?",
    description: "With 100+ cable channels and 50+ digital channel offerings, building brand awareness and consideration in Taiwan’s cluttered media scene is no easy task.\n\nThis is especially the case in the banking sector, where over 30 banks compete for share of voice. Equipped with fewer branches and ATMs than its local competitors, our client, an international bank, has to navigate this challenging and hyper-competitive landscape.\n\n\nAcorn's MarkovTM Brand Tracking helps our client design and fine-tune their communications strategy. We not only monitor market KPIs and assess campaign performance, we also evaluate key competitors' campaigns and ads. Approximately 20 ads are tracked at any point in time, one of the largest number of ads to be monitored in brand tracking in Asia. The result is extensive learnings from tracking ad performance and how it impacts customers' desirability for the brand and potential market share (a unique indicator of MarkovTM).\n\nLearnings include insights on which mnemonic device and executional detail yields better performance, eg. effect between having female vs. male characters within the ad; the impact of ad layout to optimise cut-through. This has provided input to our client in planning their media mix strategy through evaluating each media/channel effectiveness. This for example has led to the recent decision to switch from an all-digital focus back to a mixed media strategy since it was found that digital had limited impact, hence getting the media mix right and maximising advertising ROI.",

    title: "Identifying Breakthrough Ideas",
    subTitle: "A systematic evolution of future horizons.",
    description: "Our client, a leading bank in the UK, wanted to plan a strategic agenda for their retail banking business. Their strategy was intended to bring the bank to the next decade. The key challenge was to determine where they were now and where they wanted to be.\n\nAcorn’s Forward Positioning ResearchTM  (FPRTM) was used to identify breakthroughs in 3 key areas: Strategy, Tactics and Actions.\n\n\nStrategically, we need to identify a distinct positioning for the bank that would differentiate it against the competition. We found that ‘Flexible and always takes your personal circumstances into account” and “Offers innovative solutions to make banking simple” were exciting qualities and could be the lead differentiators for the bank.\n\nNext, breakthrough features and services were identified to drive the user experience.  This included introducing saving products that were just above the rate at which retail prices were increasing. This was to protect the value of consumer savings from shrinking due to increasing cost of living. An alert to customers when there was an opportunity to earn more would also help customers earn best returns.\n\nFinally, an implementation plan was drawn up with the C-suite to launch the features/ services at the right time and within the budget allocated.",
    bottomDescription: "″Thanks to all the team there. Indeed a massive accomplishment to complete this kind of project in such a short time frame. I honestly don’t think any other agency can pull this off to this level of quality. I am sure there will be follow up work to this as we begin to further understand the chosen segments and test propositions and communications with them.“",

    title: "Segmentation For The Asian Market",
    subTitle: "Understanding the wine & spirits landscape and drinker segments.",
    description: "Our client who is one of the largest players in the Wine & Spirits category wanted to expand their business in Asia. In order to develop their marketing initiatives, they needed to have a deeper understanding of Asian consumers in terms of:\n\n1. The different types of alcohol consumers across the Asian markets.\n\n2. Behavior and attitudes towards drinking Wine and Spirits of each segment.\n\n3. How to position different brands to the different types of consumers?\n\n\nAcorn’s hybrid segmentation model was used to understand the different segments by need states, demographics, psychographics, category and brand usage. Unlike a traditional consumer segmentation approach, our model is adapted for the Asian landscape and is able to drill down into each segment’s different needs for different types of wine and spirits factoring different drinking occasions and motivations.\n\nBased on the findings, our client was able to tailor a communication strategy specific to the segments for Asia. Findings from the study also helped them position their portfolio purposefully. Acorn subsequently rolled out the model to 11 other Asian markets. ",
