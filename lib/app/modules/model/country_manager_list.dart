    description: "In 2001, I joined Acorn in Singapore after graduating from the University of Manchester with a Master's degree in Economics and Econometrics. In 2002, I was given the opportunity to move to Shanghai and it proved to be an important one. Spending more than 10 years in Shanghai, I was fortunate to witness the rise of China. Showing deep interest in Chinese culture, I sharpened my skills as a market researcher especially in qualitative research.\n\nBeing fluent in Mandarin and Cantonese, I can conduct research studies across the Greater China region. Clients that I work with are from  social media, financial, automotive, food & beverage, education, alcohol and IT sectors",

    description: "‘Our finest moments are most likely to occur when we are feeling deeply uncomfortable, unhappy, or unfulfilled. For it is only in such moments, that we are likely to step out of our rut and start searching for different ways or truer answers’ -  Morgan Scott Peck\n\nI love numbers and challenges; and stepping out of my comfort zone has given me the exposure to hone my craft as a researcher. I consider myself extremely fortunate to have worked in the highly charged Mumbai, to the laid-back Middle East and now the exciting hub of South East Asia.\n\nI have done extensive research across these markets in categories including Automotive, Finance, F&B, FMCG, Telecom, which has helped me understand how cultural norms influence consumer behavior and that has helped me add value to my clients.\n\nMy career has been shaped by my colleagues and seniors; people with dynamic personalities who have the knowledge and skillset to match and I feel privileged to have them as mentors. I strongly believe that to move forward one has to have the will to keep learning and always the ability to adapt to change.",

    description: "Every day abounds with opportunities – to learn something new, to meet new people, to create new beginnings, to build something.  I have gone full circle from research agency to client and back.\n\nI have enjoyed a career in a FMCG company and spent 10 years as the Marketing Head in a global bank in the Philippines.  I have been blessed to learn from diverse bosses and cultures. I have seen how new industries evolve or new market segments emerge. It never ceases to amaze me how the world is ever changing and dynamic.\n\nThat is also why to me, every research project is a chance to seize new opportunities.  I get motivated with new collaborations. I get ecstatic when I can spot the patterns and discover a new way forward. Because these opportunities are gifts, helping the people and clients I work with is immensely fulfilling. ",

    description: "I started my career as a market researcher, and like many young recruits, we were soul searching, trying to find our own identity.  Often, one would wonder if another job, company or career would be a better fit.  As for me, it has now been 20 years with ACORN.  I have always had a strong passion for market research. I enjoy handling both qualitative and quantitative studies and have the privilege in serving many local and international clients across many industries.\n\nGood market research to me is not just about the data, but more about going beyond, and trying to find that puzzle that helps bringing the brand forward.   Even after my 20+ year of experience, I still find that Market Research is evolving and advancing all the time.  Thanks to my long-term relationships & new clienteles and the working team, they constantly rejuvenate me with new ideas, learning and drive.\n\nMy inspiration and enthusiasm come from the little things around me every day, like being the consumer myself and not just the marketer; my family and friends, my clients, and more importantly the ACORN team.  I have found my identity, and that's an Acorn Marketing Researcher",
